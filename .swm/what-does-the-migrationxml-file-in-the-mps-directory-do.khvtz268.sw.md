title: What does the `migration.xml` file in the `.mps` directory do?
---
The `migration.xml` file in the `.mps` directory is typically used by JetBrains MPS to store information about model migrations. These migrations are transformations applied to the models when the language's structure changes. However, the specific role of `migration.xml` in the mps-demo project is not explicitly defined in the repository's documentation.

The term 'migrate' in the context of the mps-demo repository is not explicitly defined in the repository's documentation. However, there is a `migration.xml` file in the `.mps` directory, which might be related to migration processes within the JetBrains MPS system.

The mps-demo project uses a specific version of JetBrains MPS. If 'migrate' refers to upgrading or changing the MPS version, you might need to adjust the project to work with the new version.
